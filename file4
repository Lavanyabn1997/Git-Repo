The git remote command in Git is used to manage connections to other repositories, referred to as "remotes." These connections are essentially bookmarks for remote repository URLs, allowing you to reference them by a convenient name rather than their full URL.

Here are some common uses and subcommands of git remote:

git remote: Lists the names of your configured remotes.

git remote -v: Lists the names of your configured remotes along with their URLs for both fetching and pushing.

git remote add <name> <URL>: Adds a new remote connection to your local repository. <name> is the alias you assign to the remote (e.g., "origin"), and <URL> is the address of the remote repository.
Code


git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

git remote rename <oldname> <newname>: Renames an existing remote connection.
Code

git remote rename origin upstream

git remote remove <name>: Removes a remote connection from your local repository.
Code

git remote remove origin

git remote show <name>: Displays detailed information about a specific remote, including its URL, tracked branches, and fetch/push configurations.
Code
    
git remote show origin

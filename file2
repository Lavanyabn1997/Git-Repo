Core Workflow
A typical Git workflow involves these stages: 
Modify files in your working directory.
Stage specific changes using git add to prepare them for the next commit.
Commit the staged changes to your local repository using git commit.
Push the committed changes to the remote repository to share them with the team.
Pull remote changes made by others to keep your local copy updated.
